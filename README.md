just another bad rouguelike game

this game was made in 2020 with Riccardo Trovato, it was a school project and it was the first decently big project that i made.

it took us about two weeks and we made all the sprites and their animations

the map generation is what i'm most proud of, it does not generateinside a matrix, instead its like a list, where each room have a pointer to the connected rooms.
this is a bit tricky because after you generate every room, you have to add a boss room and there can't be any room that's in the same place as another.
this room generation was made using recursive methods because i love them ;)

as i said all the sprites and animation was made by us in photoshop, here are some examples:
